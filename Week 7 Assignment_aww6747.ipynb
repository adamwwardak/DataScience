    "Hypothesis testing is typically used to evaluate the statistical significance of an insight. It starts with a null hypothesis assuming no effect, then uses data to calculate a test statistic and p-value—the probability of observing such data if the null were true. If the p-value falls below a set threshold (e.g., 0.05), the null is rejected and the result is deemed significant. This helps prevent confirmation bias and guards against mistaking random patterns for real effects."

This fundamental principle enables us to apply statistical methods like confidence intervals and t-tests, even when the underlying population distribution is unknown or non-normal."

    "Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis—that is, detecting a true effect when it exists. Higher power reduces the risk of failing to detect a real effect. Power is influenced by sample size, effect size, data variability, and the significance level. In practice, aiming for at least 80% power helps ensure that significant findings likely reflect real differences or effects."
